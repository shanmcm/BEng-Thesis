# The SIR Model for Spread of Disease and its analysis for COVID-19

Final project for my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics for engineering at Politecnico di Torino. <br>
The thesis shows how it is possible to model the spread of COVID-19 in Italy using a SIRD model. <br>
To better understand the code see the <em>SIR_Theory_and_Simulations.pdf</em> file, where all references are also available.
